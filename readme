# PaperTrash
PaperTrash is a mobile game project developed with Unity, which uses the Vuforia Engine for providing an Augmented Reality experience.
The goal of the game, called PaperTrash, is to throw as many paper balls into two trash bins within a certain amount of time as possible.
The trash bins are placed on markers, which get detected using the Vuforia engine. The game is developed for mobile devices, which uses the camera for the augmented reality part and swipe and tapping gestures for controlling the game.
The game developed is heavily inspired by the already existing mobile game called "Paper Toss", which is developed by Backflip Studios for iOS and Android.
